This is a Next.JS powered front-end site connected to a Supabase Database to store club information displayed on a table. Very simple site. Feel free to make any improvements as you see fit. More updates coming:
- [ ] More Filtering Options
- [ ] Live time tracking (displaying relevant real-time information)
- [ ] Cleaner List UI (current version seems out of place)
- [ ] Better landing page UI (3D animations to make things even harder to render!)
